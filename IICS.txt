IICS
-> Data Integration and ETL tool.
-> IPAAS - Integrated Platform as a service.
-> It is a cloud solution offered by Informatica.
-> It has features of Informatica Powercenter.
-> Supports batch processing and real time streaming data.

CAPABILITIES - EXAMPLE
On-premise - SQL Server
On-cloud - Cloud
Hybrid - All capabilities

ARCHITECTURE
(2 Components - Informatica Cloud, Secure Agent)

INFORMATICA CLOUD
-> Bundle of hardware and software that informatica provides.
-> Utilize resources in the cloud and run the application in the cloud.
-> Don't want to install powercenter or anything. IC can be accessed through web browser.

SECURE AGENT
-> Replaces the function of Powercenter
-> Light weight software.
-> Installed in Server, behind the organization's firewall and in on-premise.
-> Acts as a bridge between on-premise and cloud.
-> Also acts as a medium of data transfer between on-premise and cloud.
-> Process data locally and securely.
-> Integration service is replaced by secure agent in IICS.

[Informatica cloud automatically updates secure agent, restarts it aswell.
Developer do not worry about Administrator activities.]

DIFFERENCES

1> Hardware and software installed     Web browser
   [on-premise solution]  		      [cloud based solution]
2> Mapping					Same Mapping
3> Session task  				Mapping task[replaced by]
4> Workflow					Taskflow[replaced by]
						(Set of instruction to execute the mapping task)
5> PowerCenter Designer			Web based interface
   [GUI Interface]
6> Traditional ETL Service		Also provides variety of cloud native Integration Services.
						[Data Quality, Data Governance, Application Integration]
7> Integration service is reponsible   Secure agent is reponsible for execution
   for execution of workflows		of taskflows.

SERVICES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1>DATA INTEGRATION SERVICE

Runs the batch jobs, executes the mapping.

i> MAPPING TASK
-> Similar to powercenter mapping.
-> Used to define the data flow logic.

Taskflow [linear and dynamic]
-> Workflow in Powercenter
-> Combine other task and run them together in a flow.
-> Run these in sequence, parallel or decision.

ii> REPLICATION TASK
-> Replicate more than one object from to target
-> You can use either full load or incremental load for replicating the data.

iii> SYNCHRONIZATION TASK
-> Synchronize the data between the source and target.
-> Provides DML operations like insert, update, upsert and delete.
-> Sync only one object data at a time.

iv> MASKING TASK
-> Masking source data and create a data subset of source data in target.

v> POWERCENTER TASK
-> Import powercenter workflow and run it as a Cloud Data Integration Task.

vi> NOTIFICATION TASK, COMMAND TASK, WAIT TASK, EVENT TASK


2> MONITOR
-> Similar to workflow monitor.
-> Check running jobs, failed jobs, success jobs.
-> Provides options to restart/stop jobs and download logs.

3> ADMINISTRATOR
-> Where we create source and target connections, flatfile, database.
-> Download your secure agent from here and install it on your server.
-> Copy/Clone the connections.
-> Properties of Secure Agent can also be configured from here.
-> Manage run-time environments.

4> CDI - Cloud Data Integration
5> CAI - Cloud Application Integration
6> API Manager
7> Data Quality
8> Data Integration
9> Data Profiling (Scoring data as high/low profile)
10> Data Validation 
11> Data Application Service
12> Mass ingestion (Massly ingest very huge amounts of data)
[Bulk loading of data from source to target, handles large volume]
13> App integration (Data Governance)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There is no *Update Strategy Transformation* in IICS
Either you choose insert, update, delete, upsert or data driven option in target side.
by using synchronization task.

Types of Status - Start, Queued, Running, Success, Warning
		     Failed, Stopped, Aborted

Secure Agent runs 3 major service on server
DIS (Data)    - Batch jobs
PIS (Process) - Real time API's
CIS (Common)  - Command line, Shell scripts

All metadata is stored in informatica cloud repository.
As a user no access to repository database.
Can't use SQL Query.
